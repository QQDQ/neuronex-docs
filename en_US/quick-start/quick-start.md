## EMQX Neuron Installation

EMQX Neuron provides a variety of installation methods. Users can view detailed installation methods in [Installation](../installation/introduction.md). This example uses docker to start experiencing EMQX Neuron as quickly as possible.

- Get Docker image

```
$ docker pull emqx/neuronex:latest
```

- Start Docker container

```
$ docker run -d --name neuronex -p 8085:8085 --log-opt max-size=100m emqx/neuronex:latest
```

## Install Modbus simulator

Install the PeakHMI Slave Simulators software. The installation package can be downloaded from [PeakHMI official website](https://hmisys.com).

After installation, run Modbus TCP slave EX. Set the simulator point value and site number, as shown in the figure below.

![login](./_assets/login.png)

## Southbound device configuration

### Create southbound device

The southbound device is used to establish a connection between EMQX Neuron and the device, and get device data points. In this example, EMQX Neuron's Modbus TCP plugin is used to obtain data in the Modbus simulator.

Select `South Devices` in `Data Collection` menu to enter the southbound device management page, click `Add Device` to add a new device, as shown in the figure below.

![south-add](./_assets/south-add1.png)



### Configure Southbound Driver

Configure the parameters EMQX Neuron needs to establish a connection with the device.

- Name: fill in the device name, such as Modbus TCP;
- Plugin: Select the Modbus TCP plugin from the drop-down box;
- IP address: Fill in the IP address of the access device. Example: fill in the IP address of the PC side of the Modbus simulator installed;
- Port: default port 502;
- Click `Add Device` to complete the device configuration, and the device status enters the **Running** status;

![south-setting](./_assets/south-setting.png)


After the driver creation is completed, the connection status of the driver will be disconnected. To update the connection status, EMQX Neuron needs to continue with the creation of [data points configuration](#create-data-point), which will trigger EMQX Neuron to send read requests to the device.

![south-status](./_assets/south-status.png)

:::tip
The configuration parameters required for each device are different. For detailed southbound device parameter description, please refer to [Create Southbound Driver](../configuration/south-devices/south-devices.md).
:::

### Create data point


Create Group is used for grouping data points. Different collection groups can be configured with different collection interval.

Click any blank space of **modbus-tcp** node to enter the group list management page.

Click `Create Group` and fill in the relevant parameters in the `Create Group` pop-up box, as shown in the figure below.

![group-add](./_assets/group-add.png)

- Group name: fill in the group name, such as group-1;
- Interval: fill in the collection interval;
- Click `Create` to complete the group creation.

Manually create data points for the group, click any blank space in the newly created **group-1** group list to enter the point list page.

Click `Add Tags`, configure the data point attributes, type, address, etc., as shown in the figure below.

![tags-add](./_assets/tags-add.png)

- Name: fill in the name of the equipment point, for example, pressure;
- Attributes: drop down to select point attributes, for example, Read;
- Type: drop down to select the data type, for example, int16;
- Address: fill in the driving point address, for example, 1!40001;
- Click the `Create` button to complete the creation of Tag;

:::tip
Point address resolution: 1 represents the point site number set in the Modbus simulator, 40001 represents the register address of the point.

For detailed instructions on how to use the driver address, please refer to [Creating a southbound driver](../configuration/south-devices/south-devices.md).
:::

After creating the data points, EMQX Neuron automatically establishes communication with the device. The `modbus-tcp` node changes to the **Running** status and the **Connected** connection status.

If after waiting for a few seconds, the connection status is still **Disconnected**, please do the following to find out the reason:

- Please confirm that the IP address and port number are set correctly during device configuration, and the firewall is turned off.
- Execute the following command in the EMQX Neuron operating environment terminal to confirm whether the EMQX Neuron operating environment can access the corresponding IP and port:

```
$ telnet <IP of the PC running the Modbus simulator> 502
```

## View collected data

Select `Data Monitoring` under the `Data Collection` menu to enter the data monitoring page and view the values read from the device, as shown in the figure below.

![data-monitoring](./_assets/data-monitoring.png)

Data monitoring displays values in groups:

- Southbound device: drop-down box to select the southbound device you want to view, for example, select modbus-tcp created in the above step;
- Group name: Use the drop-down box to select the group you want to view under the selected southbound device. For example, select group-1 that has been created in the above step;
- Once the selection is completed, the page will display the value of data points under the group;

## Northbound application configuration

### Create northbound application node

Northbound application nodes are used for data interaction between EMQX Neuron and various northbound applications. Taking the MQTT plug-in as an example, a new MQTT node is added.

Select `North Apps` in `Data Collection` menu and click `Add Application` to add a new application, as shown in the figure below.

![north-add](./_assets/north-add.png)

- Name: fill in the application name, for example, mqtt;
- Plug-in: Select the MQTT plug-in from the drop-down box;
- Click `Create` to add a new application.

### Configure northbound application nodes

Configure the parameters required for EMQX Neuron to establish a connection with the northbound application.

After the northbound node is successfully created, it will automatically jump to the `Application Configuration` page, as shown in the figure below.

![north-setting](./_assets/north-setting.png)

- Broker Host: Fill in the mqtt broker address. By default, the public EMQX Broker `broker.emqx.io` is used;
- Broker Port: fill in the mqtt broker port, the default is 1883;
- Click `Submit` to complete the northbound application configuration, and the application card automatically enters the **Running** status.
â€‹

### Subscribe to southbound group

The collected data send to the North Apps in groups, and users need to select which groups of data to send.

Click `Add Subscription` button to add a new subscription, as shown in the figure below.

![subscription](./_assets/subscription.png)

- Topic: The topic can be customized, and the example uses the default topic;
- Subscription southbound device data: independently select the group to be subscribed;
- Click `Submit` to complete the subscription.

## View data on MQTT client

Use the MQTT client to view the uploaded data. For example, use the MQTT client tool [MQTTX](https://www.emqx.com/zh/products/mqttx) to connect to the public EMQX broker to view the data uploaded by EMQX Neuron to the MQTT Broker, as follows As shown below.

![mqttx](./_assets/mqttx.png)

After the subscription is successful, you can see that MQTTX can always receive the data collected and reported by EMQX Neuron.

- Open MQTTX to add a new connection, correctly fill in the name, Host (broker.emqx.io) and Port (default 1883) to complete the connection;
- Add a new subscription, and the Topic must be consistent with the subscription topic of the EMQX Neuron northbound application.

## Data processing

EMQX Neuron provides data processing functions, which can perform data extraction, transformation, filtering, sorting, grouping, aggregation, connection and other functions  after data collection. Through powerful streaming computing and analysis capabilities, it can realize data standardization, analysis and monitoring, and Real-time alarm. Please refer to the [Data Processing](../streaming-processing/overview.md) section for more details.

This example will introduce how to add one to the the value collected by EMQX Neuron and then send the result to the dynamic topic of MQTT broker in the cloud.

### Northbound application DataProcessing node

On the **Data Collection** -> **Northbound Application** page, EMQX Neuron has been configured with `DataProcessing` node by default. Users only need to subscribe to the **group** of **Southbound Driver** through this application, and then the data points collected by Southbound driver will be sent to the `neuronStream` stream on the **Data Processing** -> **Sources** page.

Click `Add Subscription` button to add a new subscription on **DataProcessing** App, as shown in the figure below.
![ekuiper_sub1](./_assets/ekuiper_sub1.png)
![ekuiper_sub2](./_assets/ekuiper_sub2.png)

### Create new rule

On the **Data Processing** -> **Rules** page, click `Create Rule`, as shown in the figure below.

![stream-rule](./_assets/stream-rule.png)

Click `Add Action`, as shown in the figure below.

![stream-sink](./_assets/stream-sink.png)

- Sink: Select **MQTT** plugin;
- MQTT broker address: Correctly fill in the MQTT broker address and port;
- MQTT topic: data reporting topic, the example uses the default topic;

## View stream processing results

In the example, the node_name subscribed by the data flow node is `modbus-tcp`, and the group_name is `group-1`, that is, the subscription topic is `modbus-tcp/group-1`.
