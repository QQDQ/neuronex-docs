# Product Overview

EMQX Neuron (formerly NeuronEX) is a powerful Industrial Connectivity Gateway designed for digital transformation in industrial sectors. Deployed in manufacturing, energy, building, and other industrial sites, its core mission is to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, enabling:

- **Massive Device Connectivity and Data Ingestion**: It unifies data collection from OT devices like PLCs, CNCs, robots, instrumentation, and various industrial systems through extensive protocol support.
- **Edge Intelligent Processing and Analysis**: At the edge, close to the data source, it performs real-time data filtering, cleansing, aggregation, computation, and AI-driven analysis, transforming raw data into valuable information.
- **Seamless Multi-system Integration and Linkage**: It efficiently and securely connects processed data to industrial internet platforms, cloud services, and enterprise applications (such as MES, SCADA), facilitating data flow and business collaboration.

EMQX Neuron breaks down the technical barriers between OT and IT, providing an end-to-end solution for industrial scenariosâ€”from data collection, processing, and analysis to integration. It is a core component for enterprises building stable, efficient, and intelligent edge data infrastructure.

## Product Advantages

- **Rich Protocol Integration**

    Diverse industrial protocols cater to various industrial scenarios, enabling real-time data collection and unified access for equipment data such as PLCs, CNC machines, robots, Scada systems, and smart sensors.

- **Low-Latency Data Processing**

    Designed specifically for industrial fields, EMQX Neuron offers low-latency data access and processing, facilitating rapid data transmission between multiple systems for real-time monitoring and decision-making.


- **Lightweight and Flexible Deployment**
    
    EMQX Neuron is lightweight, low-memory, and supports multiple CPU architectures. It can be deployed in Docker or Kubernetes containers.

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis Capabilities**
    - **Real-time Analytics**: A powerful built-in stream computing engine offers over 160 functions to support extraction, transformation, filtering, and aggregation of real-time data streams.
    - **Historical Insights**: The new "Data Explorer" feature, built upon Datalayers (a built-in time-series database), provides a unified data analysis interface and an intelligent SQL editor. This allows users to easily query and explore historical data stored at the edge.
    - **Visual Monitoring**: The newly added "Dashboard" visualization feature enables users to intuitively display key real-time and historical data in chart form through simple drag-and-drop configurations, creating customized edge monitoring centers.

- **AI/ML Analysis**
    
    EMQX Neuron supports user-defined function extensions and AI/ML algorithm integration. The newly introduced AI Data Analysis Assistant allows users to generate SQL queries through natural language interaction and intelligently refine them based on execution feedback. This lowers the barrier to data analysis and accelerates insight generation.

- **Platform Integration**
        
    EMQX Neuron integrates with MQTT, SparkplugB, HTTP, and other protocols to integrate data into local data centers, IIoT platforms, or cloud services.
